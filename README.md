===============================
The first step in playing this game is to open the index.html file.

This game has been developed as an assessment point in the Front-End Nano-Degree programme offered by Udacity.

This is a version of the classic Frogger Game where the objective of the game is get your player to the other side of the road, collecting prizes on the way that convert to points, without colliding with bugs.

The lady-bugs move at variable speeds that progressively increase as your score increases. The points available from the prizes are dependent on the type of prize. You control the direction of movement of your player with the arrow keys. Your progression is hampered by rocks that appear, which you cannot move through. 

Be warned that once you step off the grass verge you are committed and cannot get back onto it (although you can move in all directions on the paved area).

I would like to add a special mention to James Long for his excellent blog post on sprite-based games (http://jlongster.com/Making-Sprite-based-Games-with-Canvas), which proved invaluable in understanding some of the concepts involved.
